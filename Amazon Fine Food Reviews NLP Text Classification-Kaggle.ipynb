    "## Introduction and Motivation\n",
    "This problem dataset was taken from Kaggle website under the name \"Amazon Fine Food Reviews\". The motivation was to have an hands-on experience with a good Natural Language Processing problem along with sentiment analysis. Using the analysis in this work, a prediction model can be made to predict a recommendation/sentiment as either positive or negative."
